It all started with an idea—a fleeting spark fueled by my love for storytelling, design, and the culture of anime. I wanted to create something that felt personal, something that spoke to the creative spirit that has always driven me. Anime4Breakfast wasn’t just a name; it was a concept, a vision of bringing people together through a shared love of art, ideas, and expression.

The first ads I designed became my way of channeling that inspiration into something real. It wasn’t about following trends or making noise—it was about staying true to myself and letting my creativity take the lead. This was where the journey began.

This was where it all started—the first ads for Anime4Breakfast! Everything about this felt fresh, exciting, and brimming with potential. The concept stemmed from the JoyBoy logo I created earlier, which had this energy, this vibe that I knew I wanted to carry forward.  

Designing the ads felt almost effortless, as if they naturally followed the path that the JoyBoy logo had already paved. It wasn’t just about visuals; it was about setting a tone—a playful, yet polished feel that speaks directly to the anime-loving crowd waking up to something vibrant and unique.  

Seeing these ads come together was like watching the first spark of a much bigger fire. This is only the beginning, but I can already feel the momentum building.

Every detail in those ads felt intentional—the bold colors, the clean lines, and the subtle nods to anime culture without being too obvious. I wanted them to feel like an invitation, almost like whispering, “Hey, there’s something cool happening here, and you don’t want to miss it.”  

As I worked on them, I kept imagining the kind of audience Anime4Breakfast would attract. People scrolling through their feeds, stopping mid-scroll because something about the ad caught their eye. Maybe it was the playful familiarity of the JoyBoy vibe or the curiosity sparked by the combination of anime and breakfast.  

This process taught me something new about balance—how to merge creativity with functionality. I didn’t want these ads to feel like just another promotion; they needed to resonate, to connect. And as I wrapped up those first designs, I couldn’t help but feel a quiet sense of pride.  

Looking back, these ads were more than designs—they were an extension of me, a way to express my true self through graphic design. I wanted to capture the creativity that inspires me every day, to channel the boundless imagination and freedom that anime represents. There’s something about anime and the culture surrounding it that speaks to individuality, innovation, and connection. That spirit fueled me as I brought these ads to life.

I remember sitting there, piecing together elements of typography, imagery, and mood. The glowing cityscapes, the dynamic compositions—they all reflected how I see the world: vibrant, limitless, and full of potential. The tagline, “A place where like-minded intellects can evolve,” felt personal, like an invitation not just for others, but for myself to grow as a creative and designer.

In every line and every pixel, I was discovering more of myself. Graphic design became my language, a way to say what words couldn’t. And Anime4Breakfast? It was the perfect canvas for this expression.

These ads weren’t just the beginning of a project—they were the beginning of a journey. A journey to celebrate creativity, connection, and the joy of bringing ideas to life.
