**Artist Commentary on Sadenaruto**
<br>
<br>
Sadenaruto was a collaborative advertisement that brought together two distinct cultural currents—'80s retro anime aesthetics and the then-emerging global phenomenon of Naruto. At the heart of this project was Sade, a talented friend and avid fan of classic anime, who eagerly embraced the vision of blending nostalgic animation influences with the contemporary rise of anime fandom. This advertisement wasn’t just about showcasing a product; it was an intentional statement on the diversity within anime culture, highlighting how people from different walks of life connect through a shared love for the art form.
<br>
<br>
The project stemmed from the core idea behind Anime4Breakfast—a concept built on the belief that anime isn’t just a niche subculture but a bridge between creative genres, styles, and communities. By integrating Sade’s love for vintage anime with the contemporary Naruto craze, we crafted a visual narrative that celebrated both the old and the new, demonstrating how anime influences transcend generations. This was an early step in showing how anime, once considered an underground or niche interest, was rapidly expanding into mainstream culture, embraced by artists, musicians, designers, and creatives from diverse backgrounds.

The execution of Sadenaruto was a fusion of styles and identities, using visual storytelling to emphasize anime’s universal appeal. From the color grading and typography to the overall direction, every detail was carefully constructed to evoke both a retro anime magazine spread and a contemporary fashion-forward advertisement. This blending of aesthetics mirrored the way anime has evolved—once a passion of select enthusiasts, now an international artistic movement influencing music, fashion, and commercial branding. Today, the intersections between anime and various creative fields are more apparent than ever, and projects like Sadenaruto helped pave the way for that crossover by showcasing that anime belongs to everyone, regardless of background or industry.
