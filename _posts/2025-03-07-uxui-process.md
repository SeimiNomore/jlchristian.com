**Developing the Gumball Arcade site** in Figma was a deep dive into UX/UI, balancing visual appeal with seamless functionality. From the start, I mapped out different pages, considering how users would navigate the site and interact with its features. The goal was to create an experience that felt intuitive yet exclusive—something that didn’t just display information but engaged visitors in the mystique of Gumball Arcade.



**UX Flow & Page Interactions**

I began with wireframing, testing different layouts to determine the most effective way to guide users through the site. Navigation was a key focus—ensuring smooth transitions between pages while maintaining a structured hierarchy. I worked through different UI elements, from hover effects to interactive buttons, refining micro-interactions that would enhance the user journey. Every motion and transition had to feel deliberate, reinforcing the sleek and enigmatic nature of Gumball Arcade.

**UI Aesthetics & Text Curation**

Visually, the design had to strike a balance between modern minimalism and rich storytelling. I experimented with typography, spacing, and color schemes that complemented the brand's tone—sophisticated, mysterious, and immersive. Curating the text was just as crucial as the visual elements; the wording needed to guide users without overwhelming them, offering just enough intrigue to keep them engaged.

**Iteration & Refinement**

Each round of development brought fresh perspectives. Reviewing comments and feedback, I adjusted layouts, reworked transitions, and polished the experience with each iteration. The UX process wasn’t just about making it look good—it was about ensuring functionality felt effortless. The UI had to be clean and striking, with interactions that felt smooth and intentional.
