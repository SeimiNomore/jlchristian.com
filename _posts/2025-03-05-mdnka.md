**Artist Commentary: Midnight Kids Academy**
<br>
<br>
Midnight Kids Academy traces its origins back to Anime4Breakfast and its Midnight Kids issue—an initiative that spotlighted emerging creatives and artists I encountered online. Through Anime4Breakfast, I sought to illuminate these talents, bringing attention to their crafts and providing a platform where their work could be appreciated by a wider audience. What started as a feature soon evolved into something much larger: a movement dedicated to fostering the creative spirits who thrive in the quiet hours of the night.

Midnight Kids Academy embodies this ethos, celebrating those who find inspiration when the rest of the world is asleep. It is a space for the dreamers, the relentless innovators, and the ones who push their artistry beyond conventional boundaries. The name itself speaks to the unconventional nature of its members—individuals who embrace the night as a canvas for their ideas, refining their skills and visions outside the constraints of traditional structures.

The academy is not just a network but a thriving ecosystem of talent, built on collaboration, mentorship, and real-world application. With a curriculum that defies rigid schedules, encouraging nocturnal brainstorming sessions and unorthodox learning methods, Midnight Kids Academy champions the idea that true growth comes from stepping into the unknown. By merging fine arts, digital media, entrepreneurship, and thought leadership, it offers an immersive experience where creativity is not only nurtured but transformed into something lasting.

What began as a simple gesture to highlight underground talent has become a full-fledged initiative—a beacon for those who refuse to let their ideas fade with the setting sun. Midnight Kids Academy is where passion meets purpose, ensuring that those who shine in the night find their rightful place in the world.
