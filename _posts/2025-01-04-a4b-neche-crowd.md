The collaboration with Nolis for Anime4Breakfast came about in the most unexpected way. I first connected with his sister online, and during our conversation, she mentioned her brother’s photography and his unique creative vision. Intrigued, I asked her to have him share some of his work with me.

What I saw was phenomenal. Nolis’s photography had this raw energy, a distinct ability to merge emotion and texture seamlessly. It sparked an idea, and together, we set out to create a collection of “advertainments” for the second segment of Anime4Breakfast—A4B: Issue 2.

These pieces evolved into a bold blend of design and mixed media, perfectly capturing the underground anime vibe we wanted to convey. We drew inspiration from cult-classic anime like FLCL (Fooly Cooly), produced by the legendary [Gainax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainax) studio in collaboration with [Production I.G.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_I.G) FLCL embodies the kind of raw, niche brilliance that resonates deeply with the underground anime community, and we wanted to channel that same spirit in our work.

With Nolis’s photography providing the visual soul and my creative direction steering the narrative, we’ve built something that not only markets A4B: Issue 2 but also celebrates the culture and artistry anime represents. I’m excited to share this work with fans of anime and art alike. This is just the beginning.

Our goal was to create something that feels fresh and avant-garde, like stumbling upon a hidden gem in the anime world. With Nolis’s striking photography as the visual backbone and my creative direction shaping the narrative, we’ve crafted a campaign that not only markets A4B: Issue 2 but also celebrates the artistry and culture of anime itself.

This collaboration marks a new chapter for Anime4Breakfast, and I’m excited to share it with fans who appreciate the fusion of art and anime. Stay tuned—this is just the beginning.
