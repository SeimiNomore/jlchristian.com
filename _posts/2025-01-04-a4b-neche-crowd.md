The collaboration with Nolis for Anime4Breakfast came about unexpectedly. I connected with his sister online, and during our conversation, she mentioned her brother’s photography and his unique creative edge. Intrigued, I asked her to have him share some of his work with me.

What I saw was incredible. His eye for detail and his ability to bring emotion and texture to his photography stood out immediately. From there, the idea to collaborate was a no-brainer. Together, we set out to develop a collection of “advertainments” for the second segment of Anime4Breakfast—A4B: Issue 2.

These pieces became a bold mix of design and mixed media, reflecting the energy and innovation I envisioned for the campaign. We wanted to capture the underground anime vibe, the kind of raw and rebellious creativity you feel when discovering something like FLCL (Fooly Cooly) for the first time. It had to feel niche, fresh, and undeniably unique—like a secret gem in the anime world waiting to be unveiled.

With Nolis’s photography providing the visual soul and my creative direction steering the narrative, we’ve built something that not only markets A4B: Issue 2 but also celebrates the culture and artistry anime represents. I’m excited to share this work with fans of anime and art alike. This is just the beginning.
