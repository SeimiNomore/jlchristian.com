Kowloon was a place that I deeply appreciated. The fact that it was once considered a [world wonder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_World) made it even more intriguing. I had been searching for a concept that would represent the music label **KC.93 RR / Records & Radio**. With many musicians expressing interest in collaborating and contributing to **[Anime4breakfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime)**, I was often asked to create a label they could rally under. That inquiry eventually gave birth to **Kowloon City 93**.  

The aesthetic and mystery of **Anime4breakfast** had always been central to its appeal. When brainstorming for KC.93 RR, I sought something equally enigmatic. The inspiration came from the haunting allure of **[Gunkanjima Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashima_Island)**, an abandoned island in Japan. However, it was the **[Walled City of Kowloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City)** that truly embodied the ideal. Its dense, layered history and reputation as an urban labyrinth felt like the perfect fit for the label’s concept—an intricate and mysterious structure mirroring the ethos of the artists involved.

The journey toward discovering the brilliance of the Timothy brothers felt serendipitous, as though creativity itself had nudged me in their direction. It began with a series of engaging conversations with **Miles Timothy**, whose energy and artistic vision immediately struck a chord with me. In one such conversation, he introduced me to his brother, **Duval Timothy**, a multifaceted artist whose work carried a depth and texture that demanded attention.  

I couldn’t help but feel that meeting these two was more than chance; it was an intersection of shared s and mutual recognition of the potential in collaboration. Reflecting on their dynamic, I found myself imagining how their synergy could amplify a project I’d been cultivating for a while: **Anime4Breakfast**, my platform for creative exploration and innovation.  

It was in those early discussions that the concept for the **Deval and Miles Timothy advertisement** began to take shape. It wasn’t just an advertisement—it was a showcase of artistry, a visual narrative of how creative minds inspire and enhance each other. I wanted to capture this moment, not just for them but for myself as a document of how connections like these fuel my own creative process.  

Duval’s contributions became integral, and his ability to balance music, visual arts, and storytelling resonated deeply with my vision. You can see some of his *[work here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duval_Timothy)*, a blend of mediums that feels simultaneously intimate and expansive.  

As for Miles, his enthusiasm and unique perspective brought a grounding energy to our collaboration. Together, they inspired me to think differently about how artistry can be framed, shared, and experienced. Anime4Breakfast felt like the ideal stage to bring their collective brilliance to life, while subtly weaving my own narrative of discovery and collaboration into the mix.  

This project wasn’t just about them; it was about me finding and amplifying creative voices that align with my ethos. In working with the Timothy brothers, I wasn’t just showcasing their talents—I was discovering new dimensions of my own.  

Reflecting on this, I realize how much of my work thrives on connection: on finding kindred spirits like the Timothys and creating spaces where our creative energies intersect. It’s moments like these that remind me why I do what I do.

During this time in the development of Anime4Breakfast (A4B!), I came across so many people who genuinely appreciated the idea. It was both surprising and inspiring to find so many creatives who shared the same . One of those people was Sucka Free, a talented photographer originally from Florida who eventually made his way to New York.  

Our paths crossed at a pivotal moment when we were both focused on building our portfolios. It felt natural to collaborate, blending his photography with the aesthetic vision of A4B!. Together, we worked on several A4B! ads, each one helping to refine and elevate the brand’s style. These collaborations not only pushed the aesthetic forward but also reminded me how much creative energy can come from working with like-minded individuals.
