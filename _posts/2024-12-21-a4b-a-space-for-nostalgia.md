*Written by J. L. Christian*  

During the development phase of **Anime4Breakfast**, my goal was to create a platform that resonated deeply with my own creative process—rooted in nostalgia and inspired by the late-night hours when my ideas come to life. I wanted to channel this perspective into a shared space where like-minded individuals could gather, collaborate, and be inspired.  

The concept behind Anime4Breakfast was simple yet intentional: to design a comfortable environment that fostered creativity and connection. By building a space that reflected my own inspirations, I believed I could naturally attract other creatives who shared the same s.  

This idea also sparked the aesthetic of **Anime4Breakfast** itself. Instead of embracing the typical "[Otaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku)"-style anime fandom, I wanted to highlight the artistic depth of anime—focusing on the craftsmanship behind it. The vision was to shine a light on the [anime studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime) and their teams, the writers, the artists, and the development of their stories, while also exploring what they had in store for the future.  

Anime4Breakfast evolved into a broadcast-like network, where I conducted personal journalism on topics that bridged anime with music, fine art, fashion, and more. It became a space for exploring how these elements intersected and how they resonated with individuals from diverse career paths and walks of life who also shared a love for anime. The platform became a central sanctuary for like-minded people to gather, connect, and celebrate their s.

*Advertivment for the the first issue of the online-magazine, since the kc93 was the topic of the issue I wanted to apply the iconc airline flying over the famous Walled City of Kowloon, as since in the anime [Ghost in the Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell)*

To enhance the experience, I wanted the aesthetic to reflect upscale creativity. Inspired by the nighttime, late-night productivity, I infused elements of modern Japanese bathhouse and resort aesthetics with modern architecture, reminiscent of *[Wallpaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_(magazine))* magazine. This contrast added sophistication and depth to the platform, making it more than just a fandom hub—it became a curated, elevated space where creativity and culture could thrive.
